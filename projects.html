            <h4>Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator</h4>
            <img src="BMI-Chart copy.gif" alt=""> <!--(UK Metrric Association, 2023)-->
            <p>I created a Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator for an assignment in the programming and problem solving
                module. The language used to create this BMI Calculator was python. The purpose of this was to calculate
                the BMI
                of the user. The user would have to input their name, height and weight to get their BMI result.</p>

            <h4>Monte Carlo Simulation</h4>
            <img src="monte-carlo-simulation-0-1692132111 copy.webp" alt=""> <!--(Rana, 2024)-->
            <p>This Monte Carlo Simulation was created with python. I created the Monte Carlo Simulation in my first
                year of
                university. The purpose of this simulation was to prove the probability of winning. This was done by
                creating a loop in python to repeat the simulation a number of 'runs' stated by the user. Then once all
                the runs
                are completed, the probability of winning is calculated as a percentage.</p>

            <h4>Text analyser</h4>
            <img src="images copy.png" alt=""> <!--(Text Analyzer, 2024)-->
            <p>In my first year of studying python, I created a text analyser. This text analyser would calculate the
                total
                number of tokens, the frequency count of a particular token, the normalised frequency of the particular
                token,
                the total number of sentences and a list of sentences that contain the particular token in the text
                file.

            <img src="v4-460px-Calculate-a-Light-Year-Step-8-Version-2 copy.jpg" alt=""> <!--(wikiHow, 2025)-->
            <p>This lightyear converter converts a lightyear value to kilometers. This was a simple project that I did
                for one of my first assignments during my first year of university. This converter was created using
                python. As
                it was one of my first tasks for my assignment it was a simple program to create.</p>
